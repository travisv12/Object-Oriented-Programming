Using GitHub Copilot to Write Methods:

1. Write the method signature and let GitHub Copilot write the method body:
- For the reset method, I wrote the method signature public void reset() and GitHub Copilot suggested the body this.value = 0;.

2. Write the method signature and the first line of the method body, and let GitHub Copilot write the rest:
- For the add method, I wrote the method signature public void add(int number) and the first line if (number < 0) {. GitHub Copilot completed the rest of the method body, including the exception handling and the addition logic.

3. Write a comment describing the method in English, letting GitHub Copilot write the method body based on the comment:
- For the getValue method, I wrote the comment // Method to return the current value of the calculator and GitHub Copilot suggested the method body return this.value;.

Evaluation of GitHub Copilot:

1. Benefits:
- Speed: GitHub Copilot significantly speeds up the coding process by suggesting complete method bodies and handling boilerplate code.
- Accuracy: It provides accurate and context-aware suggestions, reducing the likelihood of syntax errors.
- Convenience: It helps in writing repetitive code quickly, allowing developers to focus on more complex logic.

2. Drawbacks:
- Over-reliance: Developers might become overly reliant on GitHub Copilot, potentially hindering their problem-solving skills.
- Context Limitations: Sometimes, the suggestions might not fully align with the specific requirements or coding style of the project.
- Learning Curve: There is a learning curve to effectively use GitHub Copilot and understand when to accept or modify its suggestions.

Overall, GitHub Copilot is a valuable tool that can enhance productivity and assist in writing code efficiently, but it should be used as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, a developer's own skills and judgment.
