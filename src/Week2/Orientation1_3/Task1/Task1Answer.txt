Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. Define Age Ranges and Probabilities:

- First, observe the age distribution of students in the group. For example, if you know the percentage of students that fall into specific age categories, define these ranges with corresponding probabilities.
- Each age range will have a cumulative probability based on the distribution percentages. For example:
  + Age 20: 16%
  + Age 21: 18%
  + Age 22: 18%
  + Age 23: 16%
  + Age 24: 14%
  + Age 25: 7%
  + Age 26: 5%
  + Age 28: 2%
  + Age 30: 2%
  + Age 35: 2%
- Calculate the cumulative probability for each age range. These cumulative values will help map random values to specific age categories.

2. Initialize Counters:

Initialize a counter for each age in the range to keep track of the number of times each age is drawn.

3. Generate Random Ages Based on Distribution:

- For each of the 1000 students (repeats 1000 times):
  + Generate a random integer between 1 and 100 to simulate the probability.
  + Use this random number to determine the age based on the cumulative probabilities:
    . For example, if the random number is 15, which is less than or equal to 16, assign age 20.
    . If the random number is 17, which is between 17 and 34, assign age 21, and so on.
  + After determining the age, increment the counter for that age.

4. Output Results:

- After all 1000 ages have been generated, print the age distribution by showing each ageâ€™s count and its percentage share.
- This gives you the approximate age distribution for the group, aligned with the specified probabilities.

Explanation of the Algorithm

1. Age Distribution Mapping:

The cumulative probabilities help in mapping a random integer to a specific age.

2. Random Number Generation:

For each student, we generate a random integer from 1 to 100. This allows us to match the number to an age range, simulating the observed distribution.

3. Efficiency:

The algorithm is efficient as it relies on a single random number per age generation and uses an array lookup to find the corresponding age range.

4. Accuracy:

With 1000 iterations, this simulation should provide a good approximation of the original distribution.
