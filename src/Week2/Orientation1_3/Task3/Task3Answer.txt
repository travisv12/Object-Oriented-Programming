In the Singleton design pattern, a Singleton object cannot be created from outside the Singleton class using the new operation because the class constructor is made private. Here’s why this is essential and how it works:

1. Private Constructor:

The primary characteristic of a Singleton class is that its constructor is marked private. This means that no external class can directly instantiate it using the new operator.
By making the constructor private, the Singleton class controls the instantiation process, ensuring only one instance is created.

2. Controlled Instantiation:

Since the Singleton pattern allows only a single instance, the class itself provides a static method (often named getInstance() or similar) that manages the instantiation process.
This method checks if an instance already exists. If it doesn’t, it creates one; if it does, it simply returns the existing instance.

3. Encapsulation of Instance Control:

With the constructor private, only the Singleton class has the authority to manage its own instance.
This design guarantees that no other part of the program can bypass this mechanism, enforcing a single point of access to the Singleton instance and thereby controlling resource usage and potential issues from multiple instantiations.

Explanation:

- Since the constructor Singleton() is private, any attempt to create a new instance from outside using new Singleton() will result in a compilation error.
- The getInstance() method controls instantiation by checking if instance is null (i.e., not created yet). If instance is null, it creates a new instance; otherwise, it returns the existing one.

This approach guarantees there is only one instance of the Singleton class in the entire application, accessible from anywhere, while preventing external classes from creating additional instances.
