a) A-phase coding:

The A-phase in the simulator is responsible for updating the simulation clock to the time of the next event.
This ensures that the simulation progresses in time and processes events in the correct order.

// A-phase: Update the simulation clock to the time of the next event
clock.setClock(eventList.getNextEventTime());

b) B-phase coding:
The B-phase processes all events that are scheduled for the current time.
This involves removing events from the event list and executing them.
Each event type has specific actions associated with it.

// B-phase: Process all events scheduled for the current time
while (eventList.getNextEventTime() == clock.getClock()) {
    Event event = eventList.remove();
    runEvent(event); // Execute the event
}

c) C-phase coding:
The C-phase checks and executes conditional events.
These are events that depend on certain conditions being met,
such as a service point being available and having customers in the queue.

// C-phase: Check and execute conditional events
for (ServicePoint servicePoint : servicePoints) {
    if (!servicePoint.isReserved() && servicePoint.isOnQueue()) {
        servicePoint.beginService();
    }
}
