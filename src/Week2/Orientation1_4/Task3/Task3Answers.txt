System Design: Real-World Scenarios

Below are two systems modeled using three or four service points, each representing real-world destinations. These systems are depicted using the graphical representation described in the Performance Variables section.

System 1: Airport Check-In and Boarding

Description:
An airport system involves passengers going through multiple service points: check-in, security screening, and boarding.

Diagram:

Arrival --> [Queue] --> (Check-In) --> [Queue] --> (Security Screening) --> [Queue] --> (Boarding) --> Departure

Service Points

Check-In: Passengers check in their luggage and receive boarding passes.
- Input Queue: Lines at the check-in counters.
- Service Point: Staff processes passenger details.

Security Screening: Ensures passengers meet safety regulations.
- Input Queue: Passengers wait in lines.
- Service Point: Security personnel check passengers and baggage.

Boarding: Passengers are guided onto the airplane.
- Input Queue: Passengers wait at the boarding gate.
- Service Point: Gate agents scan boarding passes.

System 2: Hospital Emergency Department

Description:
An emergency department involves patients going through triage, diagnosis, and treatment.

Diagram:

Arrival --> [Queue] --> (Triage) --> [Queue] --> (Diagnosis/Testing) --> [Queue] --> (Treatment) --> Discharge

Service Points

Triage: Patients are assessed based on urgency.
- Input Queue: Patients wait to be assessed.
- Service Point: Triage nurses evaluate patient condition.

Diagnosis/Testing: Patients undergo medical tests (e.g., X-rays, bloodwork).
- Input Queue: Patients wait for available diagnostic resources.
- Service Point: Diagnostic staff and equipment process patients.

Treatment: Patients receive appropriate medical care.
- Input Queue: Patients wait for available doctors or treatment rooms.
- Service Point: Doctors or nurses provide treatment.

Discharge: Patients leave the hospital after being treated or referred.
- Input Queue: Minimal or none.
- Service Point: Administrative staff complete discharge paperwork.
