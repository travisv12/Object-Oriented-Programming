Performance Measures in a Bank System

Letâ€™s consider a bank as the target system, specifically focusing on a single service point such as a teller counter.
Customers arrive, queue, and are served by the teller.

1. Directly Observable Variables

A (Arrived Clients Count)
This represents the total number of customers arriving at the bank within the observation period.
For instance, if 100 customers come to the bank during a day, A = 100.

C (Clients Serviced Count)
This is the number of customers successfully served by the teller.
If only 90 out of the 100 customers are served due to limited operating hours, C = 90.

B (Active Time in Service Point)
The cumulative time the teller spends actively serving customers.
For instance, if the teller spends 7 out of 8 working hours serving customers, B = 7 hours.

T (Total Simulation Time)
This represents the total time over which the system is observed.
In our example, the bank operates for 8 hours, so T = 8 hours.

2. Derived Variables

U (Service Point Utilization)
Utilization measures how busy the teller is relative to their available time.
It is calculated as: U = B / T
For our example, U = 7 / 8 = 0.875 or 87.5%.

X (Service Throughput)
Throughput is the number of customers served per unit of time.
It is given by: X = C / T
If 90 customers are served in 8 hours, X = 90 / 8 = 11.25 customers per hour.

S (Average Service Time)
This is the average time the teller spends serving each customer.
It is calculated as: S = B / C
For our example, S = 7 / 90 = 0.0778 hours or approximately 4.67 minutes/customer.

3. Additional Directly Observable Variables

Ri (Response Time)
For a single customer i, response time is the duration from their arrival at the queue to the completion of their service.
For instance, if a customer arrives at 10:00, waits 10 minutes, and is served in 5 minutes, their Ri = 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.

W (Cummulative Response Time)
This is the total waiting time experienced by all customers.
For example, if 90 customers collectively experience 450 minutes of waiting time: W = 450 minutes.

4. Further Derived Variables

R (Average Response Time)
The average time a customer spends in the system (waiting + service): R = W / C
If 90 customers collectively wait 450 minutes, R = 450 / 90 = 5 minutes.

N (Average Queue Length)
The average number of customers in the system (both waiting and being served) over time: N = W / T
If 90 customers collectively wait 450 minutes over 8 hours = 480 minutes, N = 450 / 480 = 0.9375 customers.

5. Meaning and Characterisation

Utilization (U) measures system efficiency.
A high U suggests good resource use but might indicate potential customer dissatisfaction due to long queues.

Throughput (X) indicates how many customers the system serves per unit time and is crucial for assessing service productivity.

Service Time (S) directly impacts throughput; faster service times improve system capacity.

Response Time (R) reflects customer satisfaction, as lower response times mean faster service.

Average Queue Length (N) helps assess the need for additional resources, like more tellers, to handle peak loads.

By analyzing these variables, the bank can optimize its operations to balance customer satisfaction and resource efficiency.
