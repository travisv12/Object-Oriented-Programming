Categories for Maintaining, Updating, and Computing Performance Measures

Performance measures in a simulation can be broadly categorized into three groups based on their relationship to the service point and customer.
These categories define how the measures are tracked, updated, and computed during the simulation:

1. Service Point Metrics
These measures focus on the operation of the service point itself, reflecting its efficiency and utilization.

Key Metrics:

B (Active Time in Service Point): Tracks the cumulative time the service point (e.g., a server or teller) is busy serving customers.
- Maintained: Updated every time a service event starts or ends.
- Updated: Incremented when a customer begins or completes service.

U (Utilization): Computed as B/T, where T is the total observation time.
- Computed: At the end of the simulation or periodically during it to assess system performance.

2. Customer-Specific Metrics
These metrics capture the experiences of individual customers, such as waiting times and response times.

Key Metrics:

Ri (Response Time): Tracks the total time from when a customer arrives until they leave the system.
- Maintained: Measured for each customer based on arrival and departure timestamps.
- Updated: Logged at the moment a customer completes service.

W (Cumulative Waiting Time): Sum of all individual response times across customers.
- Maintained: Accumulated for each completed customer.
- Computed: Periodically or at the end of the simulation.

3. System-Level Metrics
These measures provide a holistic view of the entire system's performance over time, combining both service point and customer data.

Key Metrics:

X (Throughput): Tracks the number of customers served per unit time (X=C/T).
- Maintained: Tracks the count of completed customers (C) and total observation time (T).
- Computed: Continuously updated as customers are served.

S (Service Time): Average service time for each customer (S=B/C).
- Computed: After each customer is served or periodically during the simulation.

R (Average Response Time): Tracks the average time spent by customers in the system (R=W/C).
- Computed: Continuously or at the simulationâ€™s conclusion.

N (Average Queue Length): Average number of customers in the system (N=W/T).
- Computed: By dividing cumulative waiting time by the total observation time.

4. Summary

Service Point Metrics: Monitor resource utilization and service efficiency (e.g., B, U).
Customer-Specific Metrics: Track individual experiences within the system (e.g., Ri, W).
System-Level Metrics: Provide an aggregate view of overall performance, combining service and customer data (e.g., X, S, R, N).
