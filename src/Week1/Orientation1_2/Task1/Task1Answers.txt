a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?
In a time-slice simulator for events like call handling, an arrival event triggers the beginning of a new cycle where calls enter the system. Each arrival represents a new phone call entering the queue. In a real-world scenario, calls arrive continuously, not just once, so generating a new arrival event after each call arrival mimics this continuous inflow.

By generating a new arrival event, the simulation can reflect real-time intervals between each call. This approach allows the model to simulate a steady stream of incoming calls, even when some calls are still being handled by operators. Thus, it maintains a realistic flow and prevents the simulator from running out of events to process.

b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?
The start of service should generate a service completion event. This event indicates the end of the operator's service time for a particular call, after which the operator becomes available to handle another call. The completion event allows the system to record that the call has been serviced, update the operatorâ€™s status to "available," and potentially pick up a new call from the queue.
